# ccswarm Workflow Example: E-commerce User Authentication

This document demonstrates a complete ccswarm workflow for implementing user authentication in an e-commerce platform.

## 🎯 Project Setup

### 1. Initialize ccswarm Project
```bash
# Create new project
ccswarm init \
  --name "E-commerce Authentication System" \
  --agents frontend,backend,devops,qa

# Verify configuration
ccswarm config show
```

### 2. Start Master Claude and Agents
```bash
# Start the orchestrator
ccswarm start

# Verify all agents are running
ccswarm status
```

Expected output:
```

## 🚀 Task Execution Workflow

### 3. Add High-Level Tasks
```bash
# Add user story as high-level task
ccswarm task \
  "Implement user authentication system with JWT tokens" \
  --priority critical \
  --type feature \
  --details "Users should be able to register, login, and access protected resources"
```

### 4. Task Decomposition by Master Claude

Master Claude automatically analyzes the task and creates sub-tasks for each agent:

```json
{
  "master_analysis": {
    "task_id": "auth-system-001",
    "decomposition": [
      {
        "agent": "backend-agent",
        "task": "Create JWT authentication API endpoints",
        "details": "POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, middleware for protected routes",
        "dependencies": [],
        "estimated_duration": 7200
      },
      {
        "agent": "frontend-agent", 
        "task": "Create login and registration forms",
        "details": "React components with form validation and error handling",
        "dependencies": ["backend-api-contract"],
        "estimated_duration": 5400
      },
      {
        "agent": "devops-agent",
        "task": "Configure authentication infrastructure",
        "details": "JWT secret management, rate limiting, security headers",
        "dependencies": ["backend-implementation"],
        "estimated_duration": 3600
      },
      {
        "agent": "qa-agent",
        "task": "Create comprehensive authentication tests",
        "details": "Unit, integration, and E2E tests for auth flow",
        "dependencies": ["frontend-implementation", "backend-implementation"],
        "estimated_duration": 4800
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. Agent Execution with Identity Awareness

#### Backend Agent Execution
```bash
# Check specific agent status
ccswarm status --agent backend-agent-001
```

Backend Agent automatically receives the task and responds:

```
🤖 AGENT: Backend
📁 WORKSPACE: agents/backend-agent/
🎯 SCOPE: JWT authentication API implementation

I am the Backend Agent and this task is within my specialization.

I will implement:
1. User registration endpoint with email validation
2. Login endpoint with password hashing verification  
3. JWT token generation and validation middleware
4. Password reset functionality
5. Rate limiting for auth endpoints

Starting with user model and authentication service implementation...
```

#### Frontend Agent Coordination
The frontend agent waits for API contract and then proceeds:

```
🤖 AGENT: Frontend
📁 WORKSPACE: agents/frontend-agent/
🎯 SCOPE: Authentication UI components

I am the Frontend Agent. This task is within my specialization.

I need API contract from backend-agent before proceeding with form implementation.
Waiting for coordination message...

[After receiving API contract]

Now implementing:
1. LoginForm component with TypeScript interfaces
2. RegisterForm component with validation
3. AuthContext for state management
4. Protected Route wrapper component
5. Error handling and user feedback
```

#### DevOps Agent Security Setup
```
🤖 AGENT: DevOps
📁 WORKSPACE: agents/devops-agent/
🎯 SCOPE: Authentication infrastructure security

I am the DevOps Agent. This task is within my specialization.

Setting up:
1. JWT secret management in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Rate limiting configuration in API Gateway
3. Security headers middleware
4. HTTPS certificate configuration
5. Database connection security
```

#### QA Agent Test Implementation
```
🤖 AGENT: QA
📁 WORKSPACE: agents/qa-agent/
🎯 SCOPE: Authentication testing strategy

I am the QA Agent. This task is within my specialization.

Creating comprehensive test suite:
1. Unit tests for auth service functions
2. API integration tests for all endpoints
3. E2E tests for complete user journeys
4. Security tests for common vulnerabilities
5. Performance tests for auth endpoints
```

## 🔄 Real-Time Coordination

### 6. Agent Communication Example

When the backend agent completes API implementation:

```bash
# Backend reports completion
echo '{
  "agent_id": "backend-agent-001",
  "status": "completed",
  "task": "JWT authentication API",
  "api_contract": {
    "endpoints": [
      {"method": "POST", "path": "/auth/register", "body": "RegisterUserDto"},
      {"method": "POST", "path": "/auth/login", "body": "LoginUserDto"},
      {"method": "GET", "path": "/auth/profile", "headers": "Authorization: Bearer <token>"}
    ]
  }
}' > coordination/agent-status/backend-agent-001.json
```

Frontend agent automatically receives notification and proceeds:

```
🤖 AGENT: Frontend
📁 WORKSPACE: agents/frontend-agent/
🎯 SCOPE: API contract received, implementing forms

Received API contract from backend-agent. Proceeding with form implementation:

Creating TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
interface RegisterUserDto {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

interface LoginUserDto {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
```

Implementing React components with proper validation...
```

### 7. Quality Gates in Action

- ✅ Responsive frontend forms with error handling
- ✅ Production-ready infrastructure configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (96% coverage)
- ✅ Security best practices implemented
- ✅ Performance optimized

### Time savings compared to traditional development:
- **Parallel Development**: 4.2 hours vs estimated 12+ hours sequential
- **Automated Quality Review**: Instant vs 2-3 hour manual review
- **Cross-team Coordination**: Automated vs multiple meetings
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive from start vs ad-hoc

### Key benefits demonstrated:
1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent stayed within expertise boundaries
2. **Automatic Coordination**: No manual handoffs required
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality gates prevented issues
4. **Identity Persistence**: Agents maintained role awareness throughout
5. **Master Oversight**: Technical leadership without micromanagement

This example demonstrates how ccswarm transforms complex multi-domain tasks into efficient, coordinated execution with built-in quality assurance and expert-level implementation across all domains.
