# Getting Started with ccswarm

Welcome to **ccswarm** - an AI-powered multi-agent orchestration system that manages specialized AI agents for software development. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started quickly and effectively.

## What is ccswarm?

ccswarm is a Rust-based system that coordinates specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, QA) using a Master Claude orchestrator. It features:

- **93% token savings** through intelligent session reuse
- **Native terminal management** with cross-platform PTY support
- **Autonomous orchestration** with proactive task prediction
- **Security monitoring** with OWASP Top 10 scanning
- **Collective intelligence** through democratic decision-making

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS (Windows not supported)
- **Rust**: Version 1.70 or higher
- **Git**: Version 2.20 or higher
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM recommended
- **Disk Space**: 1GB for installation + 100MB per agent worktree

### API Keys (Optional)
While you can run ccswarm in standalone mode, for full AI functionality you'll need:
- **Anthropic API Key** (recommended): For Claude-based agents
- **OpenAI API Key** (optional): For OpenAI-based agents

```bash
# Set your API keys
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Optional
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the latest stable version
cargo install ccswarm

# Verify installation
ccswarm --version
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nwiizo/ccswarm.git
cd ccswarm

# Build and install
cargo build --release
cargo install --path crates/ccswarm

# Optional: Install ai-session CLI separately
cargo install --path crates/ai-session
```

## First-Time Setup

### Interactive Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
ccswarm setup
```

This will guide you through:
1. Project configuration
2. Agent selection and roles
3. Provider configuration
4. API key setup
5. Initial project structure

### Quick Manual Setup

If you prefer manual configuration:

```bash
# Initialize a new project
ccswarm init --name "MyFirstProject" --agents frontend,backend,devops

# This creates:
# - ccswarm.json configuration file
# - Git worktrees for each agent
# - Project-specific settings
```

## Your First Project

Let's create a simple TODO application to demonstrate ccswarm's capabilities.

### Step 1: Initialize Project

```bash
# Create a new TODO app project
ccswarm init --name "TodoApp" --agents frontend,backend

# Check the created structure
ls -la
```

You should see:
- `ccswarm.json` - Main configuration file
- `frontend-agent/` - Frontend agent worktree
- `backend-agent/` - Backend agent worktree

### Step 2: Start the System

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1: Start the orchestrator**
```bash
ccswarm start
```

You'll see output like:
```
🚀 ccswarm v0.3.5 starting...
✅ Master Claude initialized (proactive mode enabled)
✅ Frontend agent ready
✅ Backend agent ready
🔒 Security agent monitoring enabled
📊 Proactive analysis running every 30s
```

**Terminal 2: Launch the monitoring UI**
```bash
ccswarm tui
```

This opens an interactive terminal interface showing:
- Real-time agent status
- Task queue and completion
- Session statistics
- System health metrics

### Step 3: Create Your First Task

```bash
# Create a high-priority feature task
ccswarm task "Create a responsive login form [high] [feature]"

# The system will:
# 1. Analyze the task with Master Claude
# 2. Determine it's frontend work
# 3. Delegate to the frontend agent
# 4. Execute the task automatically
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

In the TUI (Terminal 2), you can:
- Press `Tab` to switch between tabs
- Use `↑↓` or `jk` to navigate
- Press `c` for command mode
- Press `t` to add new tasks
- Press `q` to quit

### Step 5: Auto-Create Complete Applications

For faster development, use the auto-create feature:

```bash
# Generate a complete TODO application
ccswarm auto-create "Create a TODO app with React frontend and Node.js backend" --output ./my-todo-app

# The system will:
# 1. Analyze the requirements
# 2. Generate file structure
# 3. Create frontend components
# 4. Build backend API
# 5. Add Docker configuration
# 6. Include documentation
```

## Understanding Agent Roles

ccswarm enforces strict role boundaries to ensure quality and prevent scope creep:

### Frontend Agent
- **Responsibilities**: React, Vue, UI/UX, CSS, client-side code
- **Cannot do**: Backend APIs, database queries, server configuration
- **Tools**: Modern frontend frameworks, styling libraries, build tools

### Backend Agent  
- **Responsibilities**: APIs, databases, server logic, authentication
- **Cannot do**: UI components, styling, frontend routing
- **Tools**: Express, FastAPI, database ORMs, authentication systems

### DevOps Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure, deployment
- **Cannot do**: Application logic, UI components, business features
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, cloud platforms

### QA Agent
- **Responsibilities**: Testing, quality assurance, test coverage
- **Cannot do**: Feature implementation, infrastructure setup
- **Tools**: Jest, Pytest, Selenium, load testing tools
