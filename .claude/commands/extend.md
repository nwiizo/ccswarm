# ccswarm extend

Autonomous agent self-extension and improvement system.

## Usage
```bash
ccswarm extend <SUBCOMMAND>
```

## Subcommands
- `autonomous` - Agents analyze and propose improvements autonomously
- `propose` - Manually propose an extension
- `status` - View extension proposals and implementation status
- `stats` - Extension statistics and metrics
- `reset` - Reset knowledge base or extension history

## Description
Enables agents to autonomously analyze their performance, identify capability gaps, and propose improvements through the Sangha collective intelligence system. Agents learn from experience and continuously evolve.

## Examples
