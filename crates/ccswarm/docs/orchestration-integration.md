# Agent-Master Orchestration Integration

## Overview

The ccswarm system now features a sophisticated two-level orchestration system that enables both master-level coordination and agent-level task orchestration. This integration allows agents to break down complex tasks into manageable steps while maintaining coordination with the master orchestrator.

## Architecture

### Two-Level Orchestration

1. **Master-Level Orchestration** (MasterClaude)
   - Assigns tasks to appropriate agents based on specialization
   - Manages quality reviews and remediation
   - Provides proactive insights and context
   - Coordinates cross-agent dependencies

2. **Agent-Level Orchestration** (AgentOrchestrator)
   - Breaks complex tasks into parallel and sequential steps
   - Manages task execution within agent boundaries
   - Handles step-by-step validation and adaptation
   - Reports progress back to master

### Integration Flow

```
Master Claude
    ↓ (assigns task with context)
Agent receives task
    ↓ (evaluates complexity)
Complex? → Agent Orchestrator
    ↓ (creates execution plan)
Execute steps in parallel/sequence
    ↓ (report results)
Master Claude reviews results
```

## Key Components

### 1. Task Complexity Detection

The agent automatically detects complex tasks based on:
- Multi-step keywords ("implement", "create", "build", "integrate")
- Complexity indicators ("multiple", "comprehensive", "full")
- Task type (Feature, Infrastructure, Development)
- Priority level (High, Critical)

### 2. Context Passing

The master enriches tasks with orchestration context:
```json
{
  "orchestration_context": {
    "master_id": "master-claude-xxx",
    "agent_role": "Backend",
    "coordination_enabled": true,
    "quality_standards": {
      "min_test_coverage": 85,
      "max_complexity": 10
    },
    "proactive_insights": {
      "task_complexity": "high",
      "recommended_approach": "orchestrated_execution",
      "potential_dependencies": ["backend_api", "database_schema"],
      "similar_tasks_completed": ["task-123", "task-456"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Agent Orchestration Plans

Agents create execution plans with three phases:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Understand requirements
   - Check existing code/dependencies
   - Identify potential issues

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Implement the solution
   - Use context from analysis
   - Execute in parallel when possible

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify implementation
   - Check against requirements
   - Ensure quality standards

### 4. Role-Specific Orchestration

Each agent role has specialized orchestration behavior:

- **Frontend**: UI requirements, design system checks
- **Backend**: API requirements, dependency analysis
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure analysis, deployment checks
- **QA**: Test requirements, framework validation

## Usage Example

```rust
// Complex task that triggers orchestration
let task = Task::new(
    "task-1".to_string(),
    "Implement user authentication system with JWT tokens".to_string(),
    Priority::High,
    TaskType::Feature,
);

// Master assigns to agent with context
master.assign_task(task).await?;

// Agent detects complexity and uses orchestrator
// Automatically breaks down into:
// 1. Analyze authentication requirements
// 2. Check existing auth infrastructure
// 3. Implement JWT generation
// 4. Add refresh token mechanism
// 5. Create middleware
// 6. Validate implementation
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Task Success Rate**: Complex tasks are broken down systematically
2. **Better Resource Utilization**: Parallel execution of independent steps
3. **Enhanced Context**: Proactive insights from master guide execution
4. **Adaptive Execution**: Plans can be modified based on step results
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation steps ensure standards

## Configuration

The orchestration behavior can be influenced by:

- Task metadata and modifiers
- Agent specialization and experience
- Master Claude's quality standards
- Proactive mode insights

## Monitoring

Track orchestration through:
- Task result metadata showing orchestration usage
- Step-by-step execution logs
- Duration metrics for each phase
- Success/failure rates per step

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for better complexity detection
- Cross-agent orchestration for dependencies
- Dynamic step generation based on code analysis
- Performance optimization through caching
