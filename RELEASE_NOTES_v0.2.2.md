# Release Notes - ccswarm v0.2.2

## 🎉 Overview

ccswarm v0.2.2 brings significant enhancements inspired by Anthropic's multi-agent research system, introducing interleaved thinking patterns and an advanced LLM quality judge system.

## ✨ New Features

### Interleaved Thinking Pattern
- Agents can now evaluate and adjust their approach during task execution
- Supports Continue, Refine, RequestContext, Pivot, Complete, and Abort decisions
- Confidence-based decision making with role-specific patterns
- Thinking history tracking for transparency and debugging

### Advanced LLM Quality Judge
- Multi-dimensional code quality evaluation across 8 aspects:
  - Correctness (30%)
  - Maintainability (20%)
  - Test Quality (20%)
  - Security (15%)
  - Performance (10%)
  - Documentation (5%)
  - Architecture
  - Error Handling
- Role-specific scoring adjustments for Frontend, Backend, DevOps, and QA agents
- Intelligent issue categorization by severity levels
- Actionable remediation instructions with effort estimates
- Performance optimization through evaluation caching

### Enhanced Quality Review Cycle
- Automated quality checks every 30 seconds
- Automatic remediation task creation for detected issues
- Review history tracking with iteration counting
- Re-evaluation after remediation completion

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed task queue tests that were using persistent directories
- Corrected Backend delegation rules to properly use AND conditions
- Fixed DevOps boundary checker to correctly delegate application tasks
- Resolved all clippy warnings for full CI/CD compliance
- Fixed identity test environment variable population

## 🛠️ Improvements
- Enhanced task delegation accuracy with improved pattern matching
- Updated agent boundary checking to prioritize forbidden patterns
- Improved test infrastructure using temporary directories
- Optimized session management for better token efficiency
- Better error messages and logging throughout the system

## 📊 Quality Metrics
- All tests pass successfully
- `cargo fmt --check` compliant
- `cargo clippy` shows no warnings
- 93% token reduction maintained through session persistence
