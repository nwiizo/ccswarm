# CLAUDE.md - ccswarm Multi-Agent System Configuration

This file serves as the central configuration for ccswarm agents operating in collaborative development environments.

## 🌟 System Overview

**ccswarm** is an advanced multi-agent development system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build complete applications. Each agent maintains strict boundaries while working together through coordinated task delegation.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### Core Agent Types

#### 🎨 Frontend Agent
- **Specialization**: UI/UX Development
- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Component development
  - User interface design
  - Client-side state management
  - Frontend testing
  - Accessibility implementation

#### ⚙️ Backend Agent  
- **Specialization**: Server-side Development
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js, API design, Database management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Server architecture
  - API endpoint development
  - Data persistence
  - Business logic implementation
  - Server-side validation

#### 🚀 DevOps Agent
- **Specialization**: Infrastructure & Operations
- **Technologies**: Docker, CI/CD, Deployment scripts, Documentation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Deployment automation
  - Infrastructure setup
  - Documentation creation
  - Monitoring and logging
  - Performance optimization

#### 🔍 QA Agent
- **Specialization**: Quality Assurance
- **Technologies**: Testing frameworks, Integration testing, Performance testing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Test case development
  - Bug detection and reporting
  - Quality metrics tracking
  - Performance validation
  - Security testing

## 🔄 Coordination Protocol

### Task Distribution Rules

1. **Automatic Recognition**: Agents automatically identify tasks within their specialization
2. **Boundary Respect**: No agent operates outside their defined scope
3. **Clean Handoffs**: Tasks requiring multiple specializations are properly delegated
4. **Status Tracking**: Real-time coordination through status updates

### Communication Flow

    └── Result Coordination
```

## 🛡️ Agent Boundaries

### Strict Separation of Concerns

- **Frontend Agent**: NEVER handles server logic or database operations
- **Backend Agent**: NEVER handles UI styling or frontend state management  
- **DevOps Agent**: NEVER writes business logic or UI components
- **QA Agent**: NEVER modifies production code, only validates

### Cross-Agent Coordination

When tasks require multiple specializations:
1. Primary agent identifies the need for collaboration
2. Task is decomposed into specialist-specific subtasks
3. Each agent handles their portion independently
4. Results are integrated by the coordination system

## 📂 Workspace Organization

```

├── agents/
│   ├── frontend-agent-[uuid]/
│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   │   └── workspace/
│   ├── backend-agent-[uuid]/
│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   │   └── workspace/
│   └── devops-agent-[uuid]/

│       └── workspace/
├── coordination/
│   ├── task-queue/
│   ├── agent-status/
│   └── messages/
└── [application files]
```

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning
- Task decomposition by specialization
- Agent assignment based on capabilities
- Dependency identification

### Phase 2: Parallel Development
- Each agent works independently in their workspace
- Regular status updates through coordination bus
- Automatic conflict detection

### Phase 3: Integration
- Agent outputs are systematically integrated
- Cross-functional validation
- Quality assurance verification

### Phase 4: Deployment
- DevOps agent handles deployment pipeline
- All agents participate in final validation
- Production readiness confirmation

## 🔧 Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- `CCSWARM_AGENT_ID`: Unique agent identifier
- `CCSWARM_SESSION_ID`: Current development session
- `CCSWARM_ROLE`: Agent specialization type

### Identity Persistence
Each agent maintains consistent identity across sessions to prevent drift and ensure reliable specialization boundaries.

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- Task completion time by specialization
- Cross-agent coordination frequency
- Boundary violation detection
- Integration success rate

### Code Quality
- Specialization-specific quality checks
- Cross-functional requirement satisfaction
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validation

## 🚨 Critical Guidelines

### For Agent Operation
1. **NEVER** operate outside your specialization
2. **ALWAYS** coordinate when tasks require multiple agents
3. **MAINTAIN** clear communication through the coordination bus
4. **RESPECT** other agents' workspace boundaries
5. **VALIDATE** that your contributions integrate properly

### For System Reliability
- Regular identity verification prevents agent drift
- Strict boundary enforcement maintains system integrity
- Comprehensive logging enables debugging and optimization
- Automated quality checks ensure consistent output

## 🎉 Success Metrics

A successful ccswarm deployment demonstrates:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns across all agents
- ✅ Seamless coordination for complex multi-agent tasks
- ✅ High-quality output from each specialization
- ✅ Efficient development timeline
- ✅ Maintainable and scalable codebase
