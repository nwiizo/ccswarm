# Backend Agent Status Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive status reporting capabilities specifically for backend agents in the ccswarm system. Backend agents can now report detailed information about their API endpoints, database connections, server metrics, and active services.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **New Module: `backend_status.rs`**

Located at: `crates/ccswarm/src/agent/backend_status.rs`

This module provides:
- `BackendStatus` struct: Contains all backend-specific status information
- `BackendStatusExt` trait: Extension methods for formatting and health checks
- Methods for gathering backend metrics (API endpoints, database status, server metrics)
- Integration with the coordination system for status reporting

### 2. **Key Features**

#### Backend-Specific Metrics
- **API Endpoints**: Health status, response times, and availability
- **Database Status**: Connection status, pool size, migration info
- **Server Metrics**: CPU usage, memory consumption, uptime, error rates
- **Active Services**: Running services with their dependencies
- **Recent API Calls**: History of recent API activity

#### Health Monitoring
The implementation includes intelligent health checking:
- Backend is considered healthy if:
  - Database is connected
  - At least 80% of API endpoints are healthy
  - Error rate is below 5%

### 3. **CLI Integration**

Enhanced the `ccswarm status` command to display backend-specific information:

```bash
# Show status for all agents
ccswarm status

# Show detailed status for a specific backend agent
ccswarm status --agent backend-agent-123 --detailed
```

The status command now displays:
- API health percentage
- Database connection status
- Server resource usage
- Number of active services
- Recent API activity count

### 4. **Example Usage**

Created a demo example at: `crates/ccswarm/examples/backend_status_demo.rs`

Run with:
```bash
cargo run -p ccswarm --example backend_status_demo
```

## Architecture Integration

### Agent Methods
- `generate_backend_status()`: Creates a comprehensive backend status report
- `report_backend_status()`: Reports status to the coordination system
- Various helper methods for gathering specific metrics

### Status Structure
```rust
pub struct BackendStatus {
    pub api_endpoints: HashMap<String, EndpointStatus>,
    pub database_status: DatabaseStatus,
    pub server_metrics: ServerMetrics,
    pub active_services: Vec<ServiceInfo>,
    pub recent_api_calls: Vec<ApiCallInfo>,
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **Coordination System**: Status reports are written to the StatusTracker
2. **CLI**: The `show_status` method detects backend agents and displays specialized information
3. **Agent System**: Only backend agents can generate backend-specific status reports

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are included in the `backend_status.rs` module:
- `test_backend_status_generation`: Verifies status report generation
- `test_backend_health_check`: Tests health checking logic
- `test_backend_status_formatting`: Validates formatted output

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test -p ccswarm backend_status --lib
```

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Backend teams can monitor their services' health at a glance
2. **Integration**: Status information flows through the existing coordination system
3. **Extensibility**: The pattern can be replicated for other agent types (Frontend, DevOps, QA)
4. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health assessment based on multiple factors

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time metrics collection from actual backend services
2. Historical status tracking and trend analysis
3. Alerting when backend health degrades
4. Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
5. Custom health check criteria per project

## Files Modified/Created

1. Created: `crates/ccswarm/src/agent/backend_status.rs`
2. Modified: `crates/ccswarm/src/agent/mod.rs` (added module and exports)
3. Modified: `crates/ccswarm/src/cli/mod.rs` (enhanced status display)
4. Created: `crates/ccswarm/examples/backend_status_demo.rs`
5. Modified: `crates/ccswarm/Cargo.toml` (added example)

The implementation follows ccswarm's existing patterns and integrates seamlessly with the agent and coordination systems.
